The contents of the file /product-showcase-frontend/product-showcase-frontend/public/favicon.ico should be a valid ICO file. Since I cannot generate binary files directly, you will need to create a favicon.ico file using an image editing tool or an online favicon generator. 

Here is a placeholder comment for the favicon.ico file:
